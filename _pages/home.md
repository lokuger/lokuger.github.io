I am a PhD student in applied mathematics at [University of Hamburg](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html) and [DESY Hamburg](https://www.desy.de/index_eng.html) supervised by [Martin Burger](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/person/prof-dr-martin-burger/). I am based at DESY, where I am a member of the Computational Imaging group and as such affiliated with [DESY Photon Science](https://photon-science.desy.de/) and [Helmholtz Imaging](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/).

My work is concerned with mathematical, statistical and ML solutions of inverse problems, in particular image reconstruction problems. I have worked with multiple emission and transmission imaging modalities in various fields such as nuclear dismantling, biological and single-particle imaging or medical applications. Usually, my work entails tasks such as
- Designing ML algorithms for tasks like optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference
- Efficient software implementation of large scale imaging models and solution algorithms
- Modelling underlying physics, biology and signal processing
