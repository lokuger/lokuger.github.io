I am an applied mathematics PhD student supervised by [Martin Burger](https://en.www.math.fau.de/angewandte-mathematik-1/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-martin-burger/) at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg in Erlangen, Germany.

My work is concerned with inverse problems, in particular imaging with Compton cameras in nuclear dismantling as part of my PhD project. This includes areas such as
- Physical modelling
- Optimization & image reconstruction
- Sampling techniques & inference for large-scale inverse problems
