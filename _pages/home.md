Since June 2025, I am an ML Research Engineer at Apple, working on next-gen algorithms for *Camera* and *Photos*. Before that, I studied towards a PhD in Hamburg and Erlangen, Germany, with longer research stays for collaboration at the University of Cambridge, UK and California Institute of Technology, USA.

I have worked with photography, but also more scientific problems like emission and transmission tomography, contamination imaging in nuclear dismantling and single-particle imaging for biological macromolecules. I am excited about all math, statistics and physics (obviously), but enjoy chatting about god and the world (a great German saying, I think). If I'm not programming, you will likely find me running around Cambridge, UK, rowing on the Cam, or hiking up some mountain.
