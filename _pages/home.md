I am a PhD student in applied mathematics at [FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.de/) supervised by [Martin Burger](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/person/prof-dr-martin-burger-available-starting-april-2023/). I am permanently based at [DESY](https://www.desy.de/) in the beautiful city of Hamburg, where I am a member of the Computational Imaging group and as such affiliated with [DESY Photon Science](https://photon-science.desy.de/) and [Helmholtz Imaging](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/).

My work is concerned with inverse problems, in particular imaging with Compton cameras in nuclear dismantling as part of my PhD project. This includes areas such as
- Physical modelling
- Optimization & image reconstruction
- Sampling techniques & inference for large-scale inverse problems
