## Physical modelling of imaging systems
I have worked on the modelling of different imaging modalities, including CT and MRI, but also less known setups like Compton scattering tomography and Compton cameras. In absence of training data, the successful solution of an inverse problem usually boils down to a careful translation of physical effects into a mathematical forward model and further into efficient code.

## Image reconstruction methods
I am interested in both model-based and data-driven solutions of usually large-scale imaging inverse problems. Depending on the application, this includes variational methods, PDEs, neural networks and efficient optimization algorithms.

## Sampling and inference in inverse problems
More recently, I became interested in the application of MCMC sampling schemes to inverse problems. This includes the analysis of SPDEs like Langevin diffusion and the construction of highly efficient discretization schemes (Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms).
