## Education

Since 2023 <img width=50/> | **Applied mathematics PhD candidate** at Universität Hamburg, based at DESY Hamburg, under the supervision of [Martin Burger](https://en.www.math.fau.de/angewandte-mathematik-1/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-martin-burger/).<br>I am working on imaging setups with Compton cameras (in-situ gamma spectrometry) in nuclear decommissioning, including mathematical modelling, image reconstruction algorithms, uncertainty quantification and software development.
2021 - 2023 | **Applied mathematics PhD studies** at Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.<br>Our group moved to Hamburg in April 2023, where I will finish my PhD at UHH.
2020 - 2021 | **MASt in Applied Mathematics** (Part III), University of Cambridge, UK.<br>Graduated with distinction.
2018 - 2020 | **M.Sc. Mathematics**, University of Würzburg, Germany.<br>Graduated with distinction, awarded Otto-Volk medal for outstanding results.
2016 - 2018 | **B.Sc. Mathematics**, University of Würzburg, Germany.<br>Graduated with distinction.
