## Education

2023 - 2025 <img width=50/> | **Applied mathematics PhD candidate**, *Universität Hamburg, Germany*, based at DESY Hamburg, under the supervision of [Martin Burger](https://helmholtz-imaging.de/person/prof-dr-martin-burger/).<br>I am working on mathematical modelling, solution algorithms and uncertainty quantification for inverse imaging problems, with a particular application in gamma emission imaging for nuclear decommissioning.
2021 - 2023 | **Applied mathematics PhD studies**, *Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany*.<br>Our group moved to Hamburg in April 2023, where I will finish my PhD at UHH.
2020 - 2021 | **MASt in Applied Mathematics** (Part III), *University of Cambridge, UK*.<br>Graduated with distinction.
2018 - 2020 | **M.Sc. Mathematics**, *Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Germany*.<br>Graduated with distinction, awarded Otto-Volk medal for outstanding results.
2016 - 2018 | **B.Sc. Mathematics**, *Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Germany*.<br>Graduated with distinction.

## Positions

Since Jun 2025 | **ML Research Engineer**, *Apple, Cambridge, UK*. I work on algorithms in Apple's Camera & Photos division.
Jan 2025 - May 2025 | **Research Assistant**, *Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Hamburg, Germany*. Research within the BMBF project [COMFORT](https://www.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/comfort/) on compressed, flexible and robust ML.
Jun 2024 - Sep 2024 | **Software Engineering Intern**, *Apple Inc., Cambridge, UK*.<br>16 week internship in Apple's Camera & Photos division. I work on development of efficient image processing algorithms.
Jul 2021 - Dec 2024 | **Research Assistant**, *Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany*.<br>Position accompanying my PhD studies -- I am part of a research project on developing Compton cameras for in-situ gamma spectrometry in nuclear decommissioning.
Mar 2019 - Feb 2020 | **Student Research Assistant**, *Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, Germany*.<br>Research on Compton scattering tomography for potential medical and industrial applications.
